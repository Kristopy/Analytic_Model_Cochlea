abstract = {This paper presents an efficient method to compute the numerical solutions of transmission-line (TL) cochlear models, and its application on the model of Verhulst et al. The stability region of the model is extended by adopting a variable step numerical method to solve the system of ordinary differential equations that describes it, and by adopting an adaptive scheme to take in account variations in the system status within each numerical step. The presented method leads to improve simulations numerical accuracy and large computational savings, leading to employ TL models for more extensive simulations than currently possible.},

Because of the mathematical simplicity of this alternative, several extensions of the model are possible. In this work the compressibility of the perilymph and variations of the scalaheight are considered; other extensions are briefly discussed. The numerical calculations lead to the following conclusions: (1) the results of the one- and two-dimensional models show large quantitative but hardly any qualitative differences; (2) Von B{\'{e}}k{\'{e}}sy's [1] conclusions concerning the influence of the scalaheight upon the motion of the partition are incorrect; (3) the quantitative discrepancies between the model's results and the experiments of Rhode [6] can be eliminated by a large reduction of the scalaheight; (4) the phase difference as a function of frequency and the phase velocity show no qualitative disparities with the experimental data; (5) models with few sections, such as the hybrid computer model of Hubbard and Geisler [4] are inaccurate. {\textcopyright} 1977 Noordhoff International Publishing.},

abstract = {Many disciplines meet in the study of the auditory system. It is necessary to know the principal results ofwork in the fields of anatomy and physiology before an attempt can be made to isolate specific physical subjects. Furthermore, it is necessary to obtain a crude representation ofwhat the entire auditory system, from ear-lobe to perception, can accomplish. A partial answer to this problem is provided by the discipline of psychophysics. Accordingly, the first three sections ofthe present paper are devoted to a description ofthe most pertinent findings in psychophysics, in addition to presenting knowledge from the fields of anatomy and physiology. In section 4 the physics of the middle ear is described. The fundamental impedance transformation function as well as the modifications introduced by stiffness, mass and cavity resonance effects are treated in some detail. Section 5 presents the results of physical measurements ofthe mechanics of the cochlea (inner ear), it is possible to discern a gradual transition from a ‘classical' to a more ‘modem' viewpoint. On the basis ofthe findings presented, it is possible to develop a mathematical model of cochlear mechanics. The simplest possible solution, a one-dimensional model, is worked out in considerable detail in section 6. Since a complete solution can only be obtained by numericalmethods, several approximations are worked out to obtain analytical relationships and to deepen insight into fundamental physical factors.

abstract = {The cochlea is a hydromechanical frequency analyzer located in the inner ear (Fig. 1 a). Its principal role is to perform a realtime spectral decomposition of the acoustic signal in producing a spatial frequency map. The frequency analysis may be understood with the aid of Figure 1 b, which shows a straightened cochlea with a snapshot of its basilar membrane displaced in response to a singlefrequency sound (pure tone). Upon delivery of an acoustic signal into the fluidfilled cochlea, the basilar membrane undergoes an oscillatory motion at the frequency of the sound, resulting in a wave traveling toward its distal end. The drawing shows an instantaneous view ofthis traveling wave. The wave is spatially confined along the length of the basilar membrane, and the location of its maximum amplitude is related to the frequency of the sound. The higher the frequency, the more restricted the disturbance to the proximal end. The vibrating membrane supports the sense organ of hearing, the spiral organ of Corti (Fig. 2) which is deformed maximally in the region of the peak of the traveling wave. In this location, the sensory receptor cells of the organ of Corti receive maximal mechanical stimulation, transduce it into maximal electrical signals, and thus produce maximal afferent sensory outflow from the cochlea. Thus, mechanical frequency analysis is performed by matching particular frequencies with particular groups of auditory receptor cells and their nerve fibers. Understanding of frequency analysis in the inner ear progressed through three main epochs. The first was dominated by Helmholtz's suggestions that lightly damped, spatially ordered, mechanically resonant elements in the cochlea perform the spectral analysis (this period was reviewed by Wever, 1949). The second epoch, lasting from the late 1940s to the early 1970s was dominated by von Bekesy's description of the traveling wave (von BtkCsy, 1960). We are now in the third epoch (an overview of its evolution is given in Dallos, 1988) during which a fundamentally different paradigm has emerged. According to this paradigm, von Btktsy's traveling wave is boosted by a local electromechanical amplification process in which one of the mammalian ear's sensory cell groups, outer hair cells, function as both sensors and mechanical feedback elements. The ideas that the operation of a sense organ is dependent upon local mechanical feedback modification by what resembles a sensory receptor cell, that such mechanical feedback may operate at audio frequencies utilizing some novel cellular motor, and that},

abstract = {The mechanical tuning of the basilar membrane has not been shown to be sharp enough to explain the very narrow tuning curves observed in primary auditory fibers. A mechanism for sharpening of the frequency selectivity or an unknown "second filter" is therefore assumed to exist in the cochlea. In the present paper, several theories for frequency selec-tivity sharpening in the cochlea are studied with the aid of a basilar membrane model. It is shown that the model proposed by Zwislocki (1974) for interaction between inner and outer hair cells results in the greatest increase in selectivity. It is also shown that nonlinear basilar membrane motion may very well explain the discrepancy between mechanical and neu-ral tuning. Besides an increased selectivity at low sound intensities due to an increased low-frequency cutoff slope in the frequency transfer function, non-linear basilar membrane motion also results in an increased high-frequency cutoff slope not present in other models for frequency selectivity sharpening.},

abstract = {We present the first simultaneous sound pressure measurements in scala vestibuli and scala tympani of the cochlea in human cadaveric temporal bones. The technique we employ, which exploits microscale fiberoptic pressure sensors, enables the study of differential sound pressure at the cochlear base. This differential pressure is the input to the cochlear partition, driving cochlear waves and auditory transduction. In our results, the sound pressure in scala vestibuli (P (SV)) was much greater than scala tympani pressure (P (ST)), except for very low and high frequencies where P (ST) significantly affected the input to the cochlea. The differential pressure (P (SV) - P (ST)) is a superior measure of ossicular transduction of sound compared to P (SV) alone: (P (SV)-P (ST)) was reduced by 30 to 50 dB when the ossicular chain was disarticulated, whereas P (SV) was not reduced as much. The middle ear gain P (SV)/P (EC) and the differential pressure normalized to ear canal pressure (P (SV) - P (ST))/P (EC) were generally bandpass in frequency dependence. At frequencies above 1 kHz, the group delay in the middle ear gain is about 83 micros, over twice that of the gerbil. Concurrent measurements of stapes velocity produced estimates of cochlear input impedance, the differential impedance across the partition, and round window impedance. The differential impedance was generally resistive, while the round window impedance was consistent with compliance in conjunction with distributed inertia and damping. Our technique of measuring differential pressure can be used to study inner ear conductive pathologies (e.g., semicircular dehiscence), as well as non-ossicular cochlear stimulation (e.g., round window stimulation and bone conduction)--situations that cannot be completely quantified by measurements of stapes velocity or scala vestibuli pressure by themselves.},

Tilt and piston components vary with frequency. Separately it was shown that the pressure gain between ear canal and scala vestibuli was a remarkably flat and smooth function of frequency. Is tilt functional contributing to the pressure in the scala vestibuli and helping in smoothing the pressure gain? In experiments on gerbil the pressure in the scala vestibuli directly behind the footplate was measured while recording simultaneously the pressure produced by the sound source in the ear canal. Successively the three-dimensional motion of the stapes was measured in the same animal. Combining the vibration measurements with an anatomical shape measurement from a micro-CT (CT: computed tomography) scan the piston-like motion and the tilt of the footplate was calculated and correlated to the corresponding scala vestibuli pressure curves. No evidence was found for the hypothesis that dips in the piston velocity are filled by peaks in tilt in a systematic way to produce a smooth middle ear pressure gain function. The present data allowed calculations of the individual cochlear input impedances.},

@article{Robles2001,
abstract = {In mammals, environmental sounds stimulate the auditory receptor, the cochlea, via vibrations of the stapes, the innermost of the middle ear ossicles. These vibrations produce displacement waves that travel on the elongated and spirally wound basilar membrane (BM). As they travel, waves grow in amplitude, reaching a maximum and then dying out. The location of maximum BM motion is a function of stimulus frequency, with high-frequency waves being localized to the "base" of the cochlea (near the stapes) and low-frequency waves approaching the "apex" of the cochlea. Thus each cochlear site has a characteristic frequency (CF), to which it responds maximally. BM vibrations produce motion of hair cell stereocilia, which gates stereociliar transduction channels leading to the generation of hair cell receptor potentials and the excitation of afferent auditory nerve fibers. At the base of the cochlea, BM motion exhibits a CF-specific and level-dependent compressive nonlinearity such that responses to low-level, near-CF stimuli are sensitive and sharply frequency-tuned and responses to intense stimuli are insensitive and poorly tuned. The high sensitivity and sharp-frequency tuning, as well as compression and other nonlinearities (two-tone suppression and intermodulation distortion), are highly labile, indicating the presence in normal cochleae of a positive feedback from the organ of Corti, the "cochlear amplifier." This mechanism involves forces generated by the outer hair cells and controlled, directly or indirectly, by their transduction currents. At the apex of the cochlea, nonlinearities appear to be less prominent than at the base, perhaps implying that the cochlear amplifier plays a lesser role in determining apical mechanical responses to sound. Whether at the base or the apex, the properties of BM vibration adequately account for most frequency-specific properties of the responses to sound of auditory nerve fibers.},

abstract = {It is conjectured that the design of the cochlea is influenced by two conflicting requirements: (1) the cochlea should act as a precise frequency analyzer and (2) waves propagating along the basilar membrane should be transmitted without reflections. Accurate frequency analysis is possible only if the mechanical properties of the cochlea change rapidly with distance along the basilar membrane. Reflections of waves traveling on the basilar membrane will be negligible, however, only if these same mechanical properties change slowly. A compromise between these two requirements is possible if a loss constant $\delta$ related to the sharpness of response of the basilar membrane to a pure tone is related to the number N of wavelengths of the wave on the basilar membrane [N/($\delta$)1/2?1]. Furthermore, if sizable changes in the displacement occur only over distances larger than the width of a hair cell, then $\delta$ must be larger than the ratio of the width w of a hair cell to the distance d along the basilar membrane over which the characteristic frequency changes by an octave [$\delta$≳4N (2$\delta$)1/2 w/d]. These remarks are made explicit in a transmission‐line model of cochlear mechanics. A simple closed‐form solution of the equations, which agrees with a numerical solution, is given. The solution is compared with M{\"{o}}ssbauer measurements of basilar membrane motion. Agreement with experiment is good if N and $\delta$ are chosen appropriately. These values are consistent with both of the conjectured relations and indicate that $\delta$ is the same order of magnitude as its lowest possible value.},

Later, three more talkers were used for the "pit" sound and it was demonstrated that the difference in individuals was greater than the variation encountered for a single person, although there were no great differences in the location of the apparent source. In all these tests the talker spoke at normal speaking level. Other tests, made with a talker speaking at levels above and below normal, indicated that the source moved farther into the mouth with an increase in speaking level. This variation has not been explored in detail, but it is believed that the movement of the ap-parent source with large changes in speaking level {\o}(20 db or more) is about the same as the movement from one speech sound to another. It should be stressed that the measurements just described are of an indicative rather than a statistical nature and in no way represent final conclusions on the subject. It is to be hoped, however, that they will prove valuable to those interested in the acoustics of micro-phones and speech. A hydrodynamical theory is given for a model of the cochlea. The model consists of two channels of varying but equal cross sections. The channels are separated by an elastic membrane with variable dynamical con-stants. The two channels are interconnected at one end, and the entire structure is rigidly enclosed except for two accessible areas corresponding to the round and oval windows. The equations of motion, continuity including the effect of the membrane, and appropriate boundary conditions are formulated. As a first step toward a complete analysis the non-dissipative case is considered. Numerical solutions are found using ex-perimental data obtained by G. v. B • k • sy. Localization phenomena and phase velocities are found to be in broad agreement with experimental data.},

It begins with von B{\'{e}}k{\'{e}}sy's discovery of traveling transversal waves in the cochlea and with related early mathematical theory and ends with insights engendered by Russell and Sellick's demonstration that inner hair cells are as sharply tuned as the auditory-nerve fibers and by the finding of the M.I.T. groups of Weiss and Peak that sharp tuning of hair cells can exist in the absence of basilar-membrane tuning. Evidence for a sharpening of tuning beyond basilar-membrane vibration is reviewed and two mechanisms for such sharpening are considered - one arising from an interaction between basilar-membrane wavelength and longitudinal coupling within the tectorial membrane and one from the radial-mode resonance of the tectorial membrane and its viscoelastic coupling to the organ of the Corti. Simple calculation reveals that damping of the radial-mode vibration should be small enough to allow such a resonance. {\textcopyright} 1980.},
